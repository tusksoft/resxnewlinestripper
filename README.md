### OVERVIEW
This application strips newlines and carriage returns from resource strings in files with a .resx file extension. After compiling, simply run the application, select the folder where the resx files are located, and hit "OK" to let it do its thing. All and only .resx files will be parsed and overwritten, sans newlines/carriage returns. If the target files are not under source control, it is recommended you back up the files before running the application against them.
